My portfolio project is All Points Alert. 

I have been thinking about this since about 2016. I actually tried to implement it before using the CMS Joomla because it was, according to google the “business CMS”. It was slow due to the way I had the plugins done but it kind of worked. To this day I know it’s a good idea and possible company because there isn’t anything like it. I looked cause it would have helped out at the job I had at the time.
 
In 2012, I had a very bad injury and broke 8 vertebra. Compression fractures from c6 thru t5 which required surgeries and years of PT. Basically I was laid out for a while and found comfort online. Figured coding could be for me. After about 2 years while waiting for disability to kick in my mom’s, best-friend, husband; who was the chief of security at a large private highschool offered me a job. Basically sitting reclined in the patrol car and making sure no one broke into the student’s cars. 
 
It was during this time that I thought of this. 
 
An incident happened near the school and luckily one of the other guards working knew the security guard that was at the location where the incident occurred and they texted him to be on the lookout for this.

That got me thinking. 

How do security guards stay in contact with each other? Well, they don’t. 

If something happens at one location that other guards in the areas should be made aware of, even if they work for the same company, wont be notified unless one guard lets the other know via text. 
 
When police have a problem they issue an All Points Bulletin aka APB. That allows all officers in the area to be on the lookout for this.
 
I had that light bulb moment and was like wouldn’t it be cool if security guards could do the same. 
 
A guard can login to website and enter info like what happened, suspect info, pictures, and other relevant info in a form and it gets pushed to those in the area or working with the same company. I figured companies could use subdomains. 

I also searched the crime reports for Memphis and suburbs and put those on the website, which I am sure a scraper could do it better than manually copying and pasting like I did before. That would be the next step to learn.
 
I kept tweaking it for a while trying to improve it then had a disc rupture and another surgery which was a cervical fusion so that stopped that and eventually lost the domain but still in my head I know this is something.
